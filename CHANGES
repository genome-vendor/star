2.3.1z1 03/13/2014
SAM header changes: 
    removed "cl:" attribute from the @PG line, output it as a separate comment line
    added --outSAMheaderHD, --outSAMheaderPG, --outSAMheaderCommentFile options
Added --outTmpDir, which set the path forSTAr temporary directory independent of --outFileNamePrefix

Correct reverse complementarity of all IUPAC nucleotide codes in the SAM output.

2.3.1x 01/08/2014
Fixed a bug with --alignEndsType EndToEnd.

2.3.1v 12/21/2013
Added --alignEndsType EndToEnd option to align reads end-to-end, i.e. prohibit soft-clipping.
--outSAMattributes now allows to specify the SAM attributes in the desired combination and order.
Implemented standard (samtools-like) NM and MD tags.
Added --outSAMmapqUnique parameter (=255 by default), MAPQ value for unique mappers.

2.3.1u 11/23/2013
Added --outSAMreadID={Standard,Number} parameter to output read numbered read IDs.
Aded --outSAMmode NoQS option to suppress output of quality scores.

2.3.1s 11/06/2013
Fixed a bug that produced incorrect placement of short deletions.

2.3.1r 10/01/2013
Compilation option to output "local alignment chanins".
Compilation option to output suffix array as a text file.

2.3.1q 08/15/2013
Fixed a problem with junction overhang in SJ.out.tab file for overlapping mates.

2.3.1p 04/13/2013
Fixed GCC 4.7 compatibility problems.
Changed min memory requirement for genome generation.

2.3.1o 04/13/2013
Fixed a bug with comma separated lists of input files.

2.3.1n 04/30/2013
Replaced incorretly released 2.3.1m.

2.3.1m 04/24/2013
Fixed a bug which in some cases caused problems with long reads.

2.3.1l 04/15/2013
Fixed a problem with --readFilesCommand.

2.3.1k 04/15/2013
Fixed chimeric output for single-end reads.
Fixed a problem with --outFilterScoreMinOverLread 0 --outFilterMatchNminOverLread 0 settings.

2.3.1j 04/11/2013
Allowed spaces in paths: paths that contain spaces should be quoted with " ". Thanks for Tyler Hyndman for suggesting this patch.

2.3.1i 04/10/2013
Fixed problems with overflowing SJ buffer, new input parameters: --limitOutSJcollapsed, --limitOutSJoneRead.

2.3.1h 04/02/2013
Prevent output of strangely overlapping mates as chimeras.
Report error if --sjdbOverhang=0 with set --sjdbFileChrStartEnd or --sjdbGTFfile.

2.3.1g 03/29/2013
Implemented detection of proximal same-strand chimeras. Now it is possible to detect circular RNA (conisdered "chimeric").
More accurate treatment of overlapping mates.

2.3.1f 03/21/2013
New option --outSAMorder PairedKeepInputOrder to output alignments in the same order as they appear in the input FASTQ/A files.

2.3.1e 03/18/2013
Fixed possible problems with multi-threaded runs for small files which could have caused empty Chimeric.* and Unmapped.* output on some systems.

2.3.1d 03/17/2013
New option --outSAMprimaryFlag AllBestScore for marking all alignments with the best score as primary.
New parameter --limitOutSAMoneReadBytes 100000, limits the size of one SAM entry - important when a large number of multimappers is recorded.
Fixed a possible problem with Unmapped.* and Chimeric.* output which could generate empty or truncated output on some systems.
Coded a safer removal of the temporary directory _tmp which could have failed on some systems.
Fixed a bug which resulted in unexpected behavior for alignIntronMax < 7.

2.3.1c 03/01/2013
Fixed a bug which duplicated output in Chimeric.* and Unmapped.* when --outFilterType BySJout option is used.

2.3.1b 02/28/2013
Fixed possible issue which in some cases could have resulted in empty Chimeric.out.*

2.3.1a 02/25/2013
Fixed incorrect processing of --sjdbGTFchrPrefix.
